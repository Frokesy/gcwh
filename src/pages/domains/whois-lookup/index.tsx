            question: "What is a dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "A dedicated server is a physical server entirely reserved for your use. Unlike shared hosting, all CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth are dedicated to your website or applications, ensuring maximum performance, security, and customization.",

            id: 2,
            question: "Who should use a dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "Businesses and developers who need high performance, full control, and better security should use a dedicated server. Itâ€™s ideal for large websites, applications, and enterprises with heavy traffic.",

            answer:

            question: "How reliable are your dedicated servers?",

          },
          {
            id: 9,
            question: "Do you provide backups?",
