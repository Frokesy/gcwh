          {
            id: 1,
            question: "What is a dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "A dedicated server is a physical server entirely reserved for your use. Unlike shared hosting, all CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth are dedicated to your website or applications, ensuring maximum performance, security, and customization.",
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            question: "Who should use a dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "Businesses and developers who need high performance, full control, and better security should use a dedicated server. Itâ€™s ideal for large websites, applications, and enterprises with heavy traffic.",

            id: 3,
            question:
              "What is the difference between a VPS and a dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "A VPS (Virtual Private Server) shares physical hardware with other VPS instances, but has dedicated resources virtually. A dedicated server gives you the entire physical server without sharing.",

            question: "Can I customize my dedicated server?",
            answer:
              "Yes, you can configure CPU, RAM, storage, and software based on your exact requirements. Dedicated servers are fully customizable.",
          },
          {
            id: 5,
            question: "Do you manage the server for me?",
            answer:
              "We offer both managed and unmanaged plans. Managed means we handle maintenance, updates, and monitoring; unmanaged gives you full control.",
          },
          {
            id: 6,
            question: "What security features are included?",
            answer:
              "We provide DDoS protection, firewalls, regular security patches, and optional monitoring to ensure your server stays safe.",
          },
          {
            id: 7,
            question: "How reliable are your dedicated servers?",
            answer:
              "Our servers have a 99.9% uptime guarantee, enterprise-grade hardware, and redundant network connections for maximum reliability.",
          },
          {
            id: 8,
            question: "Can I upgrade my dedicated server later?",
            answer:
              "Yes, you can scale your hardware resources by upgrading storage, RAM, or CPU depending on your growing needs.",
          },
          {
            id: 9,
            question: "Do you provide backups?",
